'@gpuix/native': patch
---

Keep Bun responsive while GPUIX pumps embedded AppKit events on macOS.

`GpuixRenderer.tick()` now drains only native work that is ready. It no longer waits for a display-link wake, so continuously producing PTYs, timers, promises, and sockets can make progress between frames.

Fixes #39
